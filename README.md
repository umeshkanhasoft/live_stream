# 🎥 Live Streaming in Flutter using ZEGOCLOUD SDK

This Flutter project implements **live video streaming** using the **ZEGOCLOUD SDK**, allowing users to join as a **Host** or **Audience**. The host can start a live stream, and audiences can watch in real-time with low latency.

---

## 🔹 Features

✔ **Live Video & Audio Streaming** (Low Latency)  
✔ **Role Selection** (Host & Audience)  
✔ **Real-time Interaction** (Chat, Reactions)  
✔ **Cross-Platform Support** (Android, iOS, Web)  
✔ **Secure & Scalable Streaming**  

---

## 🔹 How It Works?

1️⃣ **User selects a role** (Host or Audience).  
2️⃣ **Host starts the live stream**, enabling camera & mic.  
3️⃣ **Audience joins the stream** to watch in real-time.  
4️⃣ **Users can leave/join anytime.**
